# 1 Billion Rows challenge in RUST
I came across a this challenge while while watching [ThePrimeagen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO6l1DkYA0k) where he was reading an [article by Shraddha Agarwal](https://www.shraddhaag.dev/posts/1brc) about how she approached this challenge in Go. At the time I was learning Rust and I thought it would be a good idea to try and solve this challenge in Rust. I have not yet completed the challenge but I have made some progress. I will be updating this repository as I make progress.

## What is 1BRC?
Originally proposed by [Gunnar Morling](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) as a fun exploration of how far modern Java can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file. The challenge is to read a file with one billion rows, each row containing 
"<string: cityname>,<float: temperature>" and then calculate the average, min, and max temperature for each city.
